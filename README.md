# Key Word Spotting Game

Master Thesis Project @TUGraz 
Author: Christian Walter

## Project description

The aim of this project was to implement a Key-Word-Spotting (KWS) system with neural networks trained on the speech command dataset [1] and applied in a simple video game.
Several low computational Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the fashion of [2] were evaluated.
A pre-training method using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) [3] was used to increase the accuracies.
Wavenets [4] were extended with a classification of speech commands.

## Technical Details

Operating System: Linux
Programming Language: Python 3.8.x
Neural Network Framework: Pytorch 1.7
Several packages must by installed to run the game, try and see what is missing.
Further a microphone is necessary to play the game.


## Usage

To play the game open a terminal with the project path and type:

python kws_main.py
