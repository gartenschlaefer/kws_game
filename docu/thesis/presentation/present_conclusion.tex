  Based on the Experiments one can conclude:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item MFCC with CNNs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item frame-based normalization decreases the classification, but improves overfitting effects in training
      \item 32 MFCC coeff. are often worse than 12 MFCC coeff.
      \item  
    \end{itemize}
    \item Raw Audio sample with Wavenet:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Huge amount of Computations
      \item Poor classification results with a reasonable sized model
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
