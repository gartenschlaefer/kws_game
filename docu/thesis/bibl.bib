% It is trivial to design a machine that learns very quickly, does not generalize, and requires an enormous amount of hardware. 
% In fact this learning machine has already been built and is called a Random Access Memory.

SPHINX is based on discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) with LPC- (linear-predictive-coding) derived parameters. To provide speaker independence, knowledge was added to these HMMs in several ways: multiple codebooks of fixed-width parameters, and an enhanced recognizer with carefully designed models and word-duration modeling. To deal with coarticulation in continuous speech, yet still adequately represent a large vocabulary, two new subword speech units are introduced: function-word-dependent phone models and generalized triphone models. With grammars of perplexity 997, 60, and 20, SPHINX attained word accuracies of 71, 94, and 96%, respectively, on a 997-word task.<>},
