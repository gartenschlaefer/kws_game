\chapter{Signal Processing and Feature Extraction}\label{sec:signal}
This section describes the extraction of meaningful features for speech recognition from raw audio waveform files.
The feature extraction stage compresses and reduces the dimension of input data, hence decreases computational effort for subsequent neural networks operating on the extracted features.
Moreover, this section discusses and explains properties of raw audio waveforms and the extraction to spectral features, such as the computation of a spectrogram. 
The extraction of MFCC features further includes the computation of their enhancements, such as deltas and energy features, and a suitable visual representation for them.
Furthermore, an efficient onset method to detect the start of spoken keywords in audio signals is described.
