\chapter{Signal Processing and Feature Extraction}\label{sec:signal}
This section describes the extraction of meaningful features for speech recognition from raw audio waveform files.
The feature extraction stage compresses and reduces the dimension of input data, hence decreases computational effort for subsequent neural networks operating on the extracted features.
Properties of raw audio waveforms are discussed, further the extraction to spectral features, such as the computation of a spectrogram, is explained. 
The extraction of MFCC features is described in detail, as well as enhancements with deltas and energy features and a suitable visual representation for them.
Further an efficient onset method, to detect the start of spoken key words in audio signals, is described.
