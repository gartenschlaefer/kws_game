\section{Overview}\label{sec:intro_overview}
After this introduction, \rsec{back} provides background information on the individual disciplines within this thesis.
Furthermore, it lists the research questions and give insight into problems of the KWS task for video games.
\rsec{prev} concentrates on previous and related scientific work, where a small history about neural networks is provided as well as important work on neural network architectures and work that influenced and motivated this thesis.
The audio signal processing part is located in \rsec{signal} and explains the extraction of meaningful features for speech recognition, such as MFCCs, and an onset detection method for KWS.
The feature extraction and onset detection is guided with examples to visualize their properties.
In \rsec{nn}, general theory about neural networks is described as well as the used neural network architectures and the adversarial pre-training.
\rsec{exp} presents the experiments and includes information on the dataset.
\rsec{game} describes the integrated KWS system and the game design of the deployed video game.
The thesis finishes in \rsec{conclusion} with a conclusion and an outlook to future work.
