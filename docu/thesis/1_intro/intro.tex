Controlling video games by using the voice of players in order to render certain actions within the game, is an interdisciplinary challenge between speech signal processing, machine learning, and game design.
A microphone is required to capture the voice of a player providing a speech signal of a potential command for the video game.
A pre-processing stage extracts meaningful features of the speech signal, such as the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
Further, the extracted features are used as input to a Keyword Spotting (KWS) system, which predicts the most probable keyword.
Ideally, the use of a KWS systems in video games enhances and extends the gaming experience of the players.
A simple schematic of the whole KWS process is illustrated in \rfig{intro_kws}.

For a fast paced video game, the control of game objects through voice is preferably done by using short command words, which are referred to as \emph{speech commands}.
Single words can be identified more easily than long sentences.
For instance, it is easier to recognize the word \enquote{left} than the sentence \enquote{missile target on position x, y}.
The feature extracted speech commands can then be classified through a KWS system composed of a neural network.
Note that KWS is restricted to a limited set of selected keywords, referred to as \emph{vocabulary}.
For example, in terms of video games the set of keywords might have members like \enquote{left} or \enquote{right} to move an element within the game to either left or right, respectively.
The limited set of keywords is crucial to lower the complexity of the recognition task.
This is highly recommended since in practical KWS applications it is not necessary to cover all words of a natural language.
Especially in video games, where the game environment is constrained by rules, technical limits, and play-ability, KWS is perfectly suited as an alternative or augmented control interface.
The size of the vocabulary and the selected words are two parameters that influence on the one hand the choice of the neural network architectures, which are evaluated with respect to their computational efficiency and recognition accuracy, and on the other hand the game interaction, since it limits the controls a player can choose from.
If the vocabulary of a KWS system would be too large, it would be harder to distinguish between two similar keywords.
In many KWS applications it is absolutely necessary to include labels for \enquote{noise}, \enquote{silence}, and \enquote{unknown} in the vocabulary.
The labels \enquote{noise} and \enquote{silence} should cover all sounds of the environment and the label \enquote{unknown} should represent any other possible word that is not in the vocabulary.
This is especially interesting in \emph{wake word} applications, where the vocabulary consist of only one specific keyword to activate a device.
Also in video games, those additional labels are useful to prevent the player from eliciting commands accidentally through, for instance, loud background noise.
Therefore, a KWS system demands to be very accurate and fast in its classification of keywords.

Nowadays KWS systems are considered no science-fiction anymore.
They assist consumers in everyday situations by rendering simple control tasks, such as triggering a photo release button on a \enquote{smartphone} with a single speech command.
Applications like this lead to more and more awareness of KWS and other speech recognition tasks in human society.
Unfortunately, some consumer applications with integrated speech recognition systems cause some unpleasant side effects in data privacy and energy consumption due to an externally and extensive computational processing pipeline over corporate servers \cite{Tang2018PowerConsKWS}.
It is therefore important to design KWS systems that respect private user data and provide an efficient implementation in order to reduce energy consumption.

Video games are a potential application for KWS although until now there exist only very few of them which take advantage of this special feature.
Reasons for that might be found in the history of video games itself, where players find themselves in fast paced arcade games and speech recognition is simply too slow.
Additionally the complexity of KWS and lack of training data are often two valid arguments for not considering the deployment of a KWS system into a video game.

The following two sections in this introduction will briefly explain the contributions of this thesis and give an overview of upcoming sections.
In summary, this thesis concentrates on KWS with neural networks trained through supervised learning on the speech commands dataset \cite{Warden2018SpeechCommands}.
The best suitable solutions for speech commands classification regarding video games are presented and evaluated, in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GAN), and Wavenets.
