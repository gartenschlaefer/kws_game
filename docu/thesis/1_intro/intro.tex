\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Controlling video games by using the voice of a player in order to render certain actions within the game, is an interdisciplinary challenge between speech signal processing, machine learning, and game design.
A microphone is required to capture the voice of a player providing a speech signal of a potential command for the video game.
The speech signal is usually extracted from raw audio samples to meaningful features, such as the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and being used as inputs to a Key Word Spotting (KWS) system, which has the task to classify those features to the most probable command.
The spoken command should change states of specific game objects and therefore ideally enhance and extend the gaming experience of the players.
A simple schematic of the whole process is shown in \rfig{intro_kws}.

\noindent
From a semantic perspective, the controlling of game objects should be short, clear, and best done with single command words, which are referred in the following as \emph{speech commands}.
Single words can easier be identified in comparison to long sentences, for instance, it is easier to recognize the word \enquote{left} than the sentence \enquote{missile target on position x, y}.
Further, those speech commands can be classified through a KWS system composed of a neural network.
KWS is restricted by a limited set of selected key words, referred as \emph{vocabulary}.
In terms of video games, the set of key words might have members like \enquote{left} or \enquote{right}, for example, to move an element within the game to either left or right respectively.
The limited set of key words is crucial to restrict the complexity of the recognition task, since in practical applications it is not necessary to cover all words of a natural language.
Especially in video games, where the game environment is limited by rules, technical limits, and play-ability, KWS is perfectly suited as an alternative or augmented control system.
The size of the vocabulary and the selected words are two parameters that influence on one the hand the choice of the neural network architectures, which are evaluated on their computational efficiency and accuracy performance, and on the other hand the game interaction limited by the controls a player can choose from.
If the vocabulary of a KWS system would be too large, the chance of confusion between two different key words grows naturally.
In many KWS applications it is absolutely necessary to include labels for \emph{background noise}, \emph{silence} and \emph{unknown words} in the vocabulary. 
This is especially interesting in \emph{wake word} applications, where a single key word has to be detected over the previously mentioned labels representing all other possible words that can be spoken.
Also in video games those additional labels are useful to prevent the player from eliciting unintended commands accidentally through, for instance, loud background noise.
Therefore, a KWS system demands to be very accurate and fast in its classification of key words.

Nowadays KWS systems are considered no science-fiction anymore, assisting consumers in everyday situations by rendering simple control tasks, such as triggering a photo release button on a \enquote{smartphone} with a single speech command.
Application like this leads to more and more awareness of KWS and other speech recognition tasks in human society.
Unfortunately some consumer applications with integrated speech recognition systems cause some unpleasant side effects in data privacy and energy consumption due to an externally and extensive computational processing pipeline over corporate servers \cite{Tang2018}.
It is therefore important to create KWS systems that respect private user data and provide an efficient implementation in order to save energy consumption.

Video games are a potential application for KWS although until now, however, there exist only very few of them taking advantage of this special feature.
Reasons for that might be found in the history of video games itself, where players find themselves in fast paced arcade games and speech recognition was simply too slow.
Additionally the complexity of KWS and lack of training data are often two valid arguments for not considering the deployment of a KWS system in a video game.

The following two sections in this introduction will briefly show the contributions of this thesis and give an overview of upcoming sections.
In summary, the focus of this thesis lies on KWS with neural networks trained through supervised learning on a speech command dataset \cite{Warden2018}.
The best suitable solutions for speech commands classification regarding video games are presented and evaluated with special interests in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GAN), and Wavenets.
