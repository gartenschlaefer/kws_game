\section{Video Games with Key Word Spotting}\label{sec:prev_kws_games}
Very few papers are tackling KWS specifically tied to video games and most research is conducted on gaining the best accuracies on datasets and setting new benchmark scores on them.
Nevertheless a research paper found, was that of a multiplayer video game intended for children presented in \cite{Harshavardhan2015}, which evaluates challenges when children are playing video games, such as repetitive and overlapping commanding.
On the other hand there are plenty of real world applications for KWS and ASR using available toolkits.
One very powerful tool for speech commanding widely used for video games is \texttt{VoiceAttack} running on \enquote{Windows Speech Recognition} \cite{Xiong2017}.
With \texttt{VoiceAttack} it is possible to specify own voice commands that are triggering combinations of keyboard clicks and therefore can be used to elicit actions in video games.
The applications are vast and flexible and can be applied in any game by running the program in the background.
An actual video game with integrated speech commanding ability, running with the \texttt{PocketSphinx} \cite{Huggins2006} speech recognition system, is \texttt{In Verbis Virtus}, where the players are able to cast spells by speaking out fantasy words after clicking an activation button as onset indication.
