\section{Video Games with Keyword Spotting}\label{sec:prev_kws_games}
Very few research papers are tackling KWS specifically tied to video games.
Nevertheless, a research paper on KWS in multiplayer video games intended for children is presented in \cite{Harshavardhan2015}, which evaluates challenges, such as repetitive and overlapping commanding.
On the other hand plenty of KWS and ASR toolkits for real world applications exist.
One very powerful ASR tool especially tailored to use speech commands in video games is \texttt{VoiceAttack} running on \texttt{Windows Speech Recognition} \cite{Xiong2017SpeechRecSystem}.
With \texttt{VoiceAttack} it is possible to specify own speech commands that are intended to trigger certain combinations of keyboard clicks.
This enables users to perform any possible action that any video game provides by running the program in the background.
An actual video game with integrated ASR tool is \texttt{In Verbis Virtus}, where players are able to cast spells by speaking out fantasy words after clicking an activation button as onset indication.
This game runs on the \texttt{PocketSphinx} \cite{Huggins2006PocketSphinx} speech recognition system.
