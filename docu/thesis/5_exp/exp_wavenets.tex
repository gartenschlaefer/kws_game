\section{Wavenets}
The very few experiments were performed on the Wavenet architecture shown in \rsec{nn_arch_wavenet}, because of its complex model structure and heavy computational footprint.
It took much training time and energy consumption for few epochs, further the results on the accuracy of classifying speech commands were really bad.
This architecture is therefore left for future research.
Nevertheless the experiments with ... epochs are shown in ...
