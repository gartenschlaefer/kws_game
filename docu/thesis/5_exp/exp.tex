\chapter{Experiments}\label{sec:exp}
This sections presents the experiments performed on the speech commands datasets regarding the KWS task of speech commands.
The speech commands datasets are described and analyzed in detail.
Samples from those datasets with their feature extracted representation are shown and the quality and diversity of the recordings is discussed.
The experiments were run on the neural network architectures presented in \rsec{nn_arch}.
In detail the experiments include the feature selection of MFCCs evaluated on CNN architectures to observe the impact of feature reduction and a frame-based normalization.
Furthermore, the experiments evaluate the transfer of weights from trained GANs to CNNs, and the performance of a Wavenet architecture operating on raw audio samples.
