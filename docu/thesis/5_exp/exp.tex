\chapter{Experiments}\label{sec:exp}
All experiments and their obtained results are presented in this chapter.
Before the experiments are demonstrated, the speech command datasets are described and analyzed.
Samples from those datasets with their feature extracted representation are shown and the quality and diversity of the recordings are discussed.
More importantly this chapter includes the evaluation of the neural network architectures presented in \rsec{nn_arch} for the task of Key Word Spotting (KWS) of the speech commands dataset \cite{Warden2018}.
In detail the experiments include the feature selection of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) evaluated on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, to observe the impact of feature reduction and a novel frame-based normalization.
Further Adversarial pre-training of CNNs is compared to usual training and the performance of a Wavenet architecture operating on raw audio sampels are examined.
