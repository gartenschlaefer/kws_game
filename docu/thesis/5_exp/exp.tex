\chapter{Experiments}\label{sec:exp}
All experiments performed on the speech command datasets with their obtained results are presented in this chapter.
The speech command datasets are described and analyzed in detail.
Samples from those datasets with their feature extracted representation are shown and the quality and diversity of the recordings is discussed.
The experiments were run on the neural network architectures presented in \rsec{nn_arch}.
In detail the experiments include the feature selection of MFCCs evaluated on CNN architectures, to observe the impact of feature reduction and a frame-based normalization.
Further the transfer of weights from trained GANs to CNNs is evaluated.
The performance of a Wavenet architecture operating on raw audio samples is examined.
