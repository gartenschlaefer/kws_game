\section{Experiments on Adversarial Pre-Training}\label{sec:exp_adv}
\thesisStateNotReady
Adversarial pre-training as already described in detail in \rsec{nn_adv} is the transfer of learned weights obtained from adversarial training between a Generator (G) and a Discriminator (D) network.
The target neural network architecture used for adversarial pre-training is the \texttt{conv-jim} model, described in \rsec{nn_arch_cnn}, obtaining pre-trained weights from its GAN versions the \texttt{adv-d-jim} and \texttt{adv-g-jim}, described in \rsec{nn_arch_adv}.
Note that frame-based normalization was applied, which made the training of GANs considerably more easy and the weights from the Generator network applicable.
Both adversarial pre-training techniques, the adversarial label and dual train in \rsec{nn_adv} were evaluated.

Note that the experiments in this section, like in the previous section, not meant for comparison to the benchmark networks, because of a usage of 500 examples per label instead of the whole dataset.

\subsection{Impact of Adversarial Label Train}
The adv-label-train experiments on the \texttt{conv-jim} architecture with obtained weights from either \texttt{adv-g-jim} or \texttt{adv-d-jim} are shown in \rtab{exp_adv_label_l12}.

\subsection{Impact of Adversarial Dual Train}
The adv-dual-train experiment similar to the adv-label-train experiments but without choosing subsets of labels are presented in \rtab{exp_adv_dual_l12}

% To evaluate the value of adversarial pre-training, the architecture is trained first with random init and compared to a training with adversarial pre-training. 
% The training losses of those two training methods are shown in \rfig{exp_adv_fc3_train_loss} as well as their obtained accuracies in \rfig{exp_adv_fc3_val_acc}.

% The loss and accuracy plots show how well the training was going forward for this showcase example. Both training work well and seem to converge, the one of the adversarial init parameters has a considerably faster convergence time here than the one without.
% The scores on the test sets are shown in \rtab{exp_adv_fc3_score}, where both are achieving high scores on the test set, while the adversarial init one got a few percent more, but less on the my set.
% This does not necessarily proof if one method is better or worse, therefore a more challenging task must be picked.
% But at least it shows that adversarial pre training works at least as good as random initialization.
