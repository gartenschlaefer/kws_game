\section{Experiments on Adversarial Pre-Training}\label{sec:exp_adv}
\thesisStateRevised
Adversarial pre-training, as already described in detail in \rsec{nn_adv}, is the transfer of learned weights obtained from adversarial training between a Generator (G) and a Discriminator (D) network from a GAN.
The target neural network architecture used for adversarial pre-training is the \texttt{conv-jim} model, described in \rsec{nn_arch_cnn}, obtaining pre-trained weights from its GAN versions the \texttt{adv-d-jim} and \texttt{adv-g-jim}, described in \rsec{nn_arch_adv}.
Note that frame-based normalization was applied, which made the training of GANs considerably more easy and the weights from G applicable.
Both adversarial pre-training techniques, the adversarial label and dual train explained in \rsec{nn_adv} were evaluated.

Note that the experiments in this section, like in the previous section, are not meant for comparison to the benchmark networks, because of a usage of 500 examples per label instead of the whole dataset.
Also no overfitting mechanism was applied in this experiments as well.

\subsection{Impact of Adversarial Label Train}\label{sec:exp_adv_label}
The adversarial label training experiments on the \texttt{conv-jim} architecture with obtained weights from either \texttt{adv-g-jim} or \texttt{adv-d-jim} are presented in \rtab{exp_adv_label_l12}.
\input{./5_exp/tables/tab_exp_adv_label_l12}
It can be observed that the weights from the Generator network achieves better performances than the weights from the Discriminator network.
The best models from the experiments concatenated in one accuracy plot can be seen in \rfig{exp_adv_label_acc_conv-jim}.

The noise and shift invariance test is shown in \rfig{exp_adv_label_tb_noise_conv-jim} and \rfig{exp_adv_label_tb_shift_conv-jim} respectively.

In many experiments the shift and noise invariance show improvements when using adversarial pre-training.

% adv dual train

\subsection{Impact of Adversarial Dual Train}
The adversarial dual training experiments were similar to the adversarial label train ones, but without choosing subsets of labels and simply using the same convolutional layer structure for the Generator and Discriminator model like the CNN network.
The experiments are presented in \rtab{exp_adv_dual_l12}.
\input{./5_exp/tables/tab_exp_adv_dual_l12}
The dual experiments achieved worse accuracies for the transfer of Discriminator weights, compared to the initializing of the target model with random weights.
The Generator weights however, could increase the average accuracy by at least \SI{1}{\percent}.
The dual training is not further evaluated regarding shift and noise invariance, because the adv-label-train performed in most cases better.
