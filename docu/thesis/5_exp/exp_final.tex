\section{Experiments on whole dataset}\label{sec:exp_final}
The final experiments were performed on the whole dataset with 3500 examples per labels.
All Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were evaluated with 12 MFCC coefficients and frame-based normalization.
Pre-training was done only for the \texttt{conv-jim} model in a separate run.
The results of the experiments are shown in \rtab{exp_final_l12}
