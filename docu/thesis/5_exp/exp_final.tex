\section{Experiments on whole dataset}\label{sec:exp_final}
The final experiments were performed on the whole dataset with 3500 examples per labels and are therefore used for comparison to the benchmark models shown in \rsec{prev_kws_benchmark}.
All Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were evaluated with 12 MFCC coefficients and frame-based normalization.
A single run with 2000 epochs was performed for all experiments.
The evaluation on the adversarial pre-training as described in \rsec{exp_adv} was done only for the \texttt{conv-jim} model in a separate run.
The results of the experiments are shown in \rtab{exp_final_l12}

From the results it is observed that...
