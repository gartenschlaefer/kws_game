\subsection{Menu}\label{sec:game_interactables_menu}
The game menu is the first element or scene that appears, when starting a video game. 
It usually consists of selectable buttons referencing to screens for user settings like for instance graphic or music.
With speech input deployed in a game, one additional setting is useful to be added, the setting of the recording device.
All available microphone input devices should be visualized in a list and being selectable to switch between the devices.
Further a small visualization bar of the input signals energy from the selected device is beneficial, so that the user can verify its correct functionality.
An option for adjusting the energy threshold, by which the device detects the onset of a speech signal, must be added if this property is used within the video game.
The threshold must be adjustable because of varying recording amplification factors in different microphones.
