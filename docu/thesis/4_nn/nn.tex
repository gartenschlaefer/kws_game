\chapter{Neural Networks}\label{sec:nn}
This chapter contains theoretical foundations to understand the structure of the used neural network architectures applied to the Key Word Spotting (KWS) task of speech commands.
Each used neural network architecture is described in detail.
Special focus is devoted to energy efficiency and therefore each networks energy footprint is evaluated.
Strategies for adversarial training are shown.
