\chapter{Neural Networks}\label{sec:nn}
This section contains basic theory about neural networks and a comprehension of the structure of the used neural network architectures applied to the KWS task of speech commands.
Each used neural network architecture is described in detail with a special focus devoted to energy efficiency and therefore each network's energy footprint is evaluated.
Further the adversarial pre-training scheme of using weights obtained from the training of GANs is outlined.
