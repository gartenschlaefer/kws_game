\chapter{Neural Networks}\label{sec:nn}
This section contains basic theory about neural networks and an overview of the structures of the used neural network architectures applied to the KWS task of speech commands.
Each used neural network architecture is described in detail with a special focus on its computational footprint.
Furthermore, this section outlines the adversarial pre-training scheme of using weights obtained from the training of GANs.
