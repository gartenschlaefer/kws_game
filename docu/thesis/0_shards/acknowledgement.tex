\chapter*{\germanenglish{Danksagung}{Acknowledgements}}
I am happy to thank all the people who helped and motivated me to create this master's thesis.
Great thanks belongs to my Supervisor Robert Legenstein without whom this thesis would not have been shaped to fit the likeness of an actual thesis.
Thank you for your fast and accurate responses, very valuable suggestions, and proof-reads.
Further, I would like to thank all my dear proof-readers for spending their free time in finding mistakes within this thesis.
Namely the proof-reader were: Simon Beck, Thomas Deppisch, Viktoria FÃ¼rst, Lisa Kerle, Thomas Rosenmeier, Jiwon Seo, Michael Walter, Tanja Walter, and Paavo Ylimys.
Also all contributors to the technical tools and packages used within this thesis are acknowledged, which certainly helped to finish this thesis within a mortal lifespan.
Further thanks goes to the creators of the speech commands dataset who published the dataset open access.
This saved me the effort of recording thousands of iterations of different keywords in order to play a video game with my own voice.
Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me on this long journey during a really chaotic time.
Through all your help, it is now possible to confidently publish this thesis with a good conscience.
