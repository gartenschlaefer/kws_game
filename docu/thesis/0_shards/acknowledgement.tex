%Thanks to everyone who made this thesis possible.
I am happy to thank all the people who helped and motivated me to create this Master's thesis.
Great thanks belongs to my Supervisor Robert Legenstein, without whom this thesis would not have been shaped to fit the likeness of an actual thesis.
Thank you for your fast and accurate responses, very valuable suggestions, and proof-reads.
Further, I would like to thank all my dear proof-readers for spending their valuable free-time in finding mistakes all overly placed within this thesis and hence creating a work that can be presented to others without shame.
Namely the proof-reader were: ....to be added;)
Also all contributors of the technical tools and packages used within this thesis are acknowledged, it certainly helped to finish this thesis within a mortal lifespan.
Not shall be forgotten the creators of the speech command dataset who published the dataset with open-access and saved me the effort to record thousands of iterations of different key words for being able to play the game with my voice.
At last but not least I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me on the long journey through this thesis during a really chaotic time.
