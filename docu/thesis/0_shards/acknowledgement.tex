%Thanks to everyone who made this thesis possible.
I am happy to thank all the people who helped and motivated me to create this Master's thesis.
Great thanks belongs to my Supervisor Robert Legenstein, without whom this thesis would not have been written and shaped to fit the likeness of an actual thesis.
Thank you for your fast and accurate responses, very valuable suggestions, and proof-reads.
Without any proof-readings there would be no polished thesis, therefore I would like to thank all my dear proof-readers: ....to be added;)
Thanks also belongs to all contributors of the technical tools and packages used within this thesis, it certainly helped to finish this thesis within a mortal lifespan.
Not shall be forgotten to thank the creators of the speech command dataset, who published the dataset open-access and made me not record thousands of iterations of the same key word.
At last but not least I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me on the work of this thesis during a really chaotic time.
